            JUST SHOPPER does not accept cancellation requests for any products
            listed on the website. However, refund/replacement can be made if
            the customer establishes with a full cover opening video of the
            product without any cuts made in the video.

            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the
            same to our Customer Service team on WhatsApp at 9500231901 or email
            at justshopperofficial@gmail.com with a full cover opening video.
            The request will be entertained once the Just Shopper team has
            checked and determined the same at their own end. This should be
            reported within 1 day of delivery of the products.

            as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
            customer service within 1 day of receiving the product. The Customer
            Service Team, after looking into your complaint, will take an
            appropriate decision.

          <li>
            No complaints can be made regarding products as none of the product
            comes with a warranty from manufacturers.
